    "## INTRODUCTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity is a vital resource for the functioning of any modern society, and its availability and reliability are critical for economic growth and development. Poland, being one of the largest economies in Europe, heavily relies on electricity to power its industries, businesses, and households. Understanding the trends and patterns in electricity consumption is, therefore, essential for policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions about energy policies, investments, and regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the monthly electric statistics in Poland from 2010 to 2022, with a focus on identifying the trends and patterns in electricity consumption. The analysis will be based on publicly available data from The International Energy Agency (IEA)* and will cover various aspects, including total electricity production and renewable sources. By doing so, this project seeks to provide valuable insights into the factors that influence electricity consumption in Poland and their potential impacts on the country's energy security, environment, and economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology for this project will involve data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis using various statistical techniques and tools, including time-series analysis, regression models, and visualization tools. The project's expected outcomes include identifying the main drivers of electricity consumption in Poland, forecasting future trends, and assessing the potential impacts of various policy scenarios on electricity consumption. These outcomes could provide useful information for policymakers, energy companies, and other stakeholders involved in the energy sector in Poland.\n",

    "** The International Energy Agency (IEA) is a Paris-based autonomous intergovernmental organisation, established in 1974, that provides policy recommendations, analysis and data on the entire global energy sector. The 31 member countries and 11 association countries of the IEA represent 75% of global energy demand.[1]\n",
